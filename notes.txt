APIs refer to an interface between different applications.
API forms an interface between this server and the various clients.
It refers to an interface that we write in our application to allow other applications to communicate with us.

The client instances consume the server through this API.

As you might have guessed, the API forms the entry point for all communication with the server.

However, in the use cases involving APIs, typically the clients and server belong to different organizations.

The server needs to process the request from clients that span different organizations that can be in different networks as well.

This helps the server to scale its operation by exposing a single API that addresses the request from any clients, irrespective of the client's details.
